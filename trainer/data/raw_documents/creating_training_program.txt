CREATING & STRUCTURING & VISUALLY OUTPUTTING FOOTBALL TRAINING PROGRAMS

===================================================================
SECTION 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAM OUTPUT
===================================================================

1.1. Program Duration & Structure
---------------------------------
- Training programs typically run for **4 to 12 weeks**.
- Each week is called a "microcycle".
- A group of 4 weeks (or similar) is a "mesocycle".
- **Progression** is gradual: increase in reps, sets, load, or complexity, not wholesale exercise changes.
- After each mesocycle (e.g., 4 weeks), introduce new or varied exercises to stimulate adaptation and prevent monotony.

1.2. Visual Output Format
-------------------------
- Use **tables** or **lists** to show weekly splits.
- Clearly separate each week or phase.
- Use **bold** or **highlighting** for changes or key progressions.
- Indicate **sets, reps, intensity, or other variables** for each exercise.
- Use section headers (e.g., “Week 1”, “Week 2”) for clarity.
- Include a **progression note** at the start of each week.
- Optionally, use color or icons (if supported) to signify new exercises or deload weeks.

1.3. User Guidance
------------------
- Begin with an **overview**: duration, main focus, expected outcomes.
- For each week:  
  - List daily sessions.
  - List exercises per session, with prescribed sets/reps/intensity.
  - Note any specific goals or changes from previous week.
- At the start and end of each phase (e.g., every 4 weeks), suggest a **progress check**.

2.1. Sample 8-Week Program Output

============================================
PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Duration: 8 weeks

**Saturday:**  
- Match simulation (Full 90 min or modified)

**Sunday:**  
- Rest

------------------------
WEEK 2: Progression
------------------------
- **Increase intensity**: Add 1 set or 2 reps to main strength exercises.
- Increase plank hold to 40 seconds.
- Passing drills now 5 sets x 8 reps.

(Repeat structure as above, with changes highlighted in bold or italics)

------------------------
WEEK 3: Further Progression
------------------------
- **Increase sprint distance to 25 meters.**
- Add 5% more weight to strength exercises.
- Dribbling technique with added defender (if available).

------------------------
WEEK 4: Peak of First Mesocycle
------------------------
- **Add 1 set to all strength exercises.**
- Small-sided games for 4 x 8 min.
- Technical drills: add weak-foot passing.

------------------------
WEEK 5: New Phase / Variation
------------------------
- **Change main lower body exercise (e.g., Front Squat instead of Back Squat).**
- New agility ladder patterns.
- Tactical session: add transition play.

(Continue progressions in reps/sets as above)

------------------------
WEEK 6–8: Continue to Progress
------------------------
- Gradually increase reps, sets, or intensity.
- Introduce new technical/tactical drills as needed.
- Week 8: **Deload** (reduce volume by 30-50%) and assess progress.

============================================
2.2. Output Formatting Tips

- Use **tables** for clarity if platform allows.
- Highlight progressions (e.g., `*Week 3: Increase to 4 sets*`).
- If space permits, add **progression graphs** (e.g., sets/reps over time).

Example Table (Text):

| Week | Exercise        | Sets x Reps | Notes                  |
|------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1    | Back Squat      | 3x8         | 60% 1RM                |
| 2    | Back Squat      | 4x8         | +1 set                 |
| 3    | Back Squat      | 4x10        | +2 reps per set        |
| 4    | Back Squat      | 4x10        | Maintain, focus on form|
| 5    | Front Squat     | 3x8         | Change exercise        |

===================================================================
SECTION 3: PRACTICAL OUTPUT GUIDELINES FOR LLM/RAG SYSTEMS
===================================================================

3.1. Personalization
--------------------
- Adjust sets, reps, and intensity based on user’s skill and training history.
- Allow user to select number of weeks (4–12).
- Provide clear instructions for “progression” (e.g., “If you complete all sets easily, add 1–2 reps next week”).

3.2. Visual Clarity
-------------------
- Clearly label each week and day.
- Use indentation, bullet points, or tables for readability.
- Summarize progression at the top of each week:  
  e.g., “**This week: Increase all lifts by 1 set.**”

3.3. Progression Logic
----------------------
- Do not change exercises more than every 4 weeks unless for injury/preference.
- Progress primarily by sets/reps/intensity.
- After a mesocycle, introduce some new variations (grip, stance, tempo, exercise).

3.4. Deloads and Checks
-----------------------
- For programs longer than 8 weeks, insert a deload (reduced intensity/volume) every 4–6 weeks.
- At the end of each phase, prompt user to assess progress (self-rating, test).

===================================================================
